            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Unity of command provides that an employee is responsible to only one supervisor, who in turn is responsible to only one supervisor, and so on up the organizational hierarchy. This is true even if the top of the organization is led by a group of people. For example, imagine you are the CEO of a technology firm in Silicon Valley. While the board of directors of your company governs the policy making and strategic planning, under the concept of unity of command, you do not answer to all members of the board, but only the chairman of the board.
Let's take a minute and climb a corporate ladder to demonstrate how unity of command works from the bottom up. Imagine that you are a new systems analyst for the technology company in Silicon Valley. For better or worse, you are at the bottom rung and you supervise no one. However, you do answer to your unit supervisor, who answers to her department manager. The department manager answers to the vice president of operations, who answers to the CEO. The CEO answers to the chairman of the board of directors.
